sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log

2026-01-07T10:53:29.188477Z 6 [Note] [MY-010454] [Server] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost: i#7A,y+0-XAn

Why this is acceptable (important)

Packages are downloaded over HTTPS

Repo is repo.mysql.com (Oracle)

This workaround is documented and widely used on EL8

You are disabling GPG only for this repo, not system-wide

Rocky 8 + MySQL 8 regularly breaks GPG verification.
You did everything correctly.

🚀 What I recommend next (now that MySQL will FINALLY work)

mysql_secure_installation

Fix auth for Node.js (mysql2, caching_sha2_password)

Create users properly (no ERROR 1064)

Optional: enable remote access
