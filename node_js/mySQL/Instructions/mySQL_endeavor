Installing MariaDB/MySQL system tables in '/var/lib/mysql' ...
OK

To start mariadbd at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mariadb.service to the right place for your system


Two all-privilege accounts were created.
One is root@localhost, it has no password, but you need to
be system 'root' user to connect. Use, for example, sudo mariadb
The second is mysql@localhost, it has no password either, but
you need to be the system 'mysql' user to connect.
After connecting you can set the password, if you would need to be
able to connect as any of these users with a password and without sudo

See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at https://mariadb.com/kb

You can start the MariaDB daemon with:
cd '/usr' ; /usr/bin/mariadbd-safe --datadir='/var/lib/mysql'

You can test the MariaDB daemon with mariadb-test-run.pl
cd '/usr/mariadb-test' ; perl mariadb-test-run.pl
